        <h3> As your Data Science Course in Kerala?</h3>
        <p>
          At TRON Academy, we changed data science course in Kerala by focusing
          on marketplace relevance in every lesson. Our students do not learn
          MERN Stack and WordPress skills through lectures; instead, they start
          working on client-ready applications from Day 1. With a 100% Job
          Guarantee and International Certification, you don't just learn to
          code - you build a portfolio, and more importantly, you begin your
          career.
